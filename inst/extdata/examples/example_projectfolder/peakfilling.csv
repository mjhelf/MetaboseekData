"XCMS","",""
"expandMz","0.005","numeric(1) defining the value by which the mz width of peaks should be expanded. Each peak is expanded in mz direction by expandMz * their original mz width. A value of 0 means no expansion, a value of 1 grows each peak by 1 * the mz width of the peak resulting in peakswith twice their original size in mz direction (expansion by half mz width to both sides)."
"expandRt","5","numeric(1), same as expandRt but for the retention time width."
"ppm","3","numeric(1) optionally specifying a ppm by which the mz width of the peak region should be expanded. For peaks with an mz width smaller than mean(c(mzmin, mzmax)) * ppm / 1e6, the mzmin will be replaced by mean(c(mzmin, mzmax)) - (mean(c(mzmin, mzmax)) * ppm / 2 / 1e6) and mzmax by mean(c(mzmin, mzmax)) + (mean(c(mzmin, mzmax)) * ppm / 2 / 1e6). This is applied before eventually expanding the mz width using the expandMz parameter."

"METABOSEEK","","These are parameters for Mseek peak filling:"
"ppm_m","5","mz width, in ppm around the xcms-reported mz"
"rtw","5","retention time window width, in seconds around the xcms-reported rtmin and rtmax"
"rtrange","TRUE","True if rtw should extend from rtmin and rtmax, false if rtmid should be used instead"
"areaMode","FALSE","if TRUE, will calculate peak areas rather than mean intensities"
