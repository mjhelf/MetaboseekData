"","Value","Description"
"TITLE","CAMERA analysis parameters","Set parameters for peak annotation with the CAMERA package"
"polarity","positive","positive or negative, important for adduct annotation!"
"ppm","5","ppm error for isotope and adduct searches"
"mzabs","0.005","allowed variance for isotope and adduct searches"
"FWHM-Grouping","_______","Group peaks of a xsAnnotate object according to there retention time into pseudospectra-groups. Uses the peak full widths at half maximum (FWHMs) as grouping borders. Returns xsAnnotate object with pseudospectra informations."
"sigma","3","the multiplier of the standard deviation. peakwidth at FWHM is about 2.335*sigma, sigma factor should correspond to what max rt difference can be for features to be grouped."
"perfwhm","0.5","percentage of the width of the FWHM"
"groupCorr","_______","Peak grouping after correlation information into pseudospectrum groups for an xsAnnotate object. Return an xsAnnotate object with grouping information."
"cor_eic_th","0.75","Correlation threshold for EIC correlation (0…1)"
"pval","0.05","p-value threshold for testing correlation of significance"
"findIsotopes","_______","Annotate isotope peaks for a xsAnnotate object. Returns a xsAnnotate object with annotated isotopes."
"maxcharge","3","max. number of the isotope charge"
"maxiso","4","max. number of the isotope peaks"
"minfrac","0","in case of multiple samples, percentaged value of samples, which have to contain the correct C12/C13 ratio and are not NA"
"filter","FALSE","Should C12/C13 filter be applied"
